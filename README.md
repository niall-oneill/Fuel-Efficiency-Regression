# Evaluating the Ability of Regression Models to Predict Fuel Efficiency of Cars

In this project, I predicted the fuel efficiency of cars, using regression models. The capacity to predict the fuel efficiency of cars is valueable given the effect of fuel consumption on global warming as well as air quality in cities. An accurate model could provide insights into which specific features of a car contribute the most to the fuel efficiency of cars, informing decision making in automotive engineering.

The dataset used in this project is from the UCI machine learning repository and concerns the city-cycle fuel consumption of cars, with 8 features as follows: (number of cylinders, displacement (engine size), horsepower, weight, acceleration, model year, origin, car name.) There are 398 records.

The main objective of this project is to logically deduce which regression model is most suitable for the prediction of fuel efficiency using this data set, to assess and compare the performance of the selected regression models and highlight any key learnings along the way.
